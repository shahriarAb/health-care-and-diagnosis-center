            <article className="mt-8 text-center text-lg text-blue-500">Great experience as a first timer. I barely waited to be helped when I checked in. The staff and Dr. X were all very friendly and helpful. I especially loved how Dr. (Name) really took his time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options. I had a great visit and the doctorâ€™s demeanor has really put me at ease so I highly recommend this clinic.</article>
